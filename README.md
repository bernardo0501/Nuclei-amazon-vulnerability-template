# Nuclei-amazon-vulnerability-template

This Nuclei template sends GET requests to the root directory, /admin, and /phpmyadmin, which are commonly used for web-based administration interfaces. The template uses filters to search for words and regular expressions in the response body, which may indicate the presence of AWS access keys or other sensitive information. The matchers are used to check for AWS-specific keywords, such as "EC2" and "Lambda", and to ensure that the HTTP response code is valid.  You can customize this template to fit your specific needs, such as adding additional paths to scan or modifying the filter and matcher rules to search for specific keywords or patterns.
